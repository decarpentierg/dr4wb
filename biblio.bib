	abstract = {The Wasserstein barycenter is a geometric construct which captures the notion of centrality among probability distributions, and which has found many applications in machine learning. However, most algorithms for ﬁnding even an approximate barycenter suﬀer an exponential dependence on the dimension d of the underlying space of the distributions. In order to cope with this “curse of dimensionality,” we study dimensionality reduction techniques for the Wasserstein barycenter problem. When the barycenter is restricted to support of size n, we show that randomized dimensionality reduction can be used to map the problem to a space of dimension O(log n) independent of both d and k, and that any solution found in the reduced dimension will have its cost preserved up to arbitrary small error in the original space. We provide matching upper and lower bounds on the size of the reduced dimension, showing that our methods are optimal up to constant factors. We also provide a coreset construction for the Wasserstein barycenter problem that signiﬁcantly decreases the number of input distributions. The coresets can be used in conjunction with random projections and thus further improve computation time. Lastly, our experimental results validate the speedup provided by dimensionality reduction while maintaining solution quality.},

	abstract = {The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma is a fundamental result in probability with several applications in the design and analysis of algorithms in high dimensional geometry. Most known constructions of linear embeddings that satisfy the Johnson-Lindenstrauss property involve randomness. We address the question of explicitly constructing such embedding families and provide a construction with an almost optimal use of randomness: we use O(log(n/delta)log(log(n/delta)/epsilon)) random bits for embedding n dimensions to O(log(1/delta)/epsilon{\textasciicircum}2) dimensions with error probability at most delta, and distortion at most epsilon. In particular, for delta = 1/poly(n) and fixed epsilon, we use O(log n loglog n) random bits.

	abstract = {In a variety of research areas, the weighted bag of vectors and the histogram are widely used descriptors for complex objects. Both can be expressed as discrete distributions. D2-clustering pursues the minimum total within-cluster variation for a set of discrete distributions subject to the {KantorovichWasserstein} metric. D2-clustering has a severe scalability issue, the bottleneck being the computation of a centroid distribution, called Wasserstein barycenter, that minimizes its sum of squared distances to the cluster members. In this paper, we develop a modiﬁed Bregman {ADMM} approach for computing the approximate discrete Wasserstein barycenter of large clusters. In the case when the support points of the barycenters are unknown and have low cardinality, our method achieves high accuracy empirically at a much reduced computational cost. The strengths and weaknesses of our method and its alternatives are examined through experiments, and we recommend scenarios for their respective usage. Moreover, we develop both serial and parallelized versions of the algorithm. By experimenting with large-scale data, we demonstrate the computational efﬁciency of the new methods and investigate their convergence properties and numerical stability. The clustering results obtained on several datasets in different domains are highly competitive in comparison with some widely used methods in the corresponding areas.},

The general idea is to introduce an entropic regularization of the initial linear program. This regularized problem corresponds to a Kullback-Leibler Bregman divergence projection of a vector (representing some initial joint distribution) on the polytope of constraints. We show that for many problems related to optimal transport, the set of linear constraints can be split in an intersection of a few simple constraints, for which the projections can be computed in closed form. This allows us to make use of iterative Bregman projections (when there are only equality constraints) or more generally Bregman-Dykstra iterations (when inequality constraints are involved). We illustrate the usefulness of this approach to several variational problems related to optimal transport: barycenters for the optimal transport metric, tomographic reconstruction, multi-marginal optimal transport and in particular its application to Brenier’s relaxed solutions of incompressible Euler equations, partial un-balanced optimal transport and optimal transport with capacity constraints.},

However, clustering based on the Kantorovich metric under a principled optimization criterion is computationally challenging, and has not been adequately explored. In this paper, we focus on the scalability issue and develop a new algorithm for clustering distributions. An optimal centroid or representative distribution in the sense of the Kantorovich metric is solved for each cluster. The key idea is to adapt the state-of-the-art distributed optimization approach called alternating direction method of multipliers ({ADMM}). The new algorithm achieves linear complexity in the update of each centroid and can be easily parallelizable, improving signiﬁcantly over the existing method. It is also observed that in practice, satisfactory results can be obtained after a few tens of iterations. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real data to demonstrate the computational efﬁciency and accuracy of the new algorithm.},

This mean, known as the Wasserstein barycenter, is the measure that minimizes the sum of its Wasserstein distances to each element in that set. We propose two original algorithms to compute Wasserstein barycenters that build upon the subgradient method. A direct implementation of these algorithms is, however, too costly because it would require the repeated resolution of large primal and dual optimal transport problems to compute subgradients. Extending the work of Cuturi (2013), we propose to smooth the Wasserstein distance used in the deﬁnition of Wasserstein barycenters with an entropic regularizer and recover in doing so a strictly convex objective whose gradients can be computed for a considerably cheaper computational cost using matrix scaling algorithms. We use these algorithms to visualize a large family of images and to solve a constrained clustering problem.},

	abstract = {Interpolation between pairs of values, typically vectors, is a fundamental operation in many computer graphics applications. In some cases simple linear interpolation yields meaningful results without requiring domain knowledge. However, interpolation between pairs of distributions or pairs of functions often demands more care because features may exhibit translational motion between exemplars. This property is not captured by linear interpolation. This paper develops the use of displacement interpolation for this class of problem, which provides a generic method for interpolating between distributions or functions based on advection instead of blending. The functions can be non-uniformly sampled, high-dimensional, and deﬁned on non-Euclidean manifolds, e.g., spheres and tori. Our method decomposes distributions or functions into sums of radial basis functions ({RBFs}). We solve a mass transport problem to pair the {RBFs} and apply partial transport to obtain the interpolated function. We describe practical methods for computing the {RBF} decomposition and solving the transport problem. We demonstrate the interpolation approach on synthetic examples, {BRDFs}, color distributions, environment maps, stipple patterns, and value functions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07443},
	abstract = {Eﬃciently aggregating data from diﬀerent sources is a challenging problem, particularly when samples from each source are distributed diﬀerently. These diﬀerences can be inherent to the inference task or present for other reasons: sensors in a sensor network may be placed far apart, aﬀecting their individual measurements. Conversely, it is computationally advantageous to split Bayesian inference tasks across subsets of data, but data need not be identically distributed across subsets. One principled way to fuse probability distributions is via the lens of optimal transport: the Wasserstein barycenter is a single distribution that summarizes a collection of input measures while respecting their geometry. However, computing the barycenter scales poorly and requires discretization of all input distributions and the barycenter itself. Improving on this situation, we present a scalable, communication-eﬃcient, parallel algorithm for computing the Wasserstein barycenter of arbitrary distributions. Our algorithm can operate directly on continuous input distributions and is optimized for streaming data. Our method is even robust to nonstationary input distributions and produces a barycenter estimate that tracks the input measures over time. The algorithm is semi-discrete, needing to discretize only the barycenter estimate. To the best of our knowledge, we also provide the ﬁrst bounds on the quality of the approximate barycenter as the discretization becomes ﬁner. Finally, we demonstrate the practical eﬀectiveness of our method, both in tracking moving distributions on a sphere, as well as in a large-scale Bayesian inference task.},

	title = {On the Complexity of Approximating Wasserstein Barycenters},
	abstract = {We study the complexity of approximating the Wasserstein barycenter of m discrete measures, or histograms of size n, by contrasting two alternative approaches that use entropic regularization. The ﬁrst approach is based on the Iterative Bregman Projections ({IBP}) algorithm for which our novel analysis gives a complexity bound proportional to mn2/ε2 to approximate the original non-regularized barycenter. On the other hand, using an approach based on accelerated gradient descent, we obtain a complexity proportional to mn2/ε. As a byproduct, we show that the regularization parameter in both approaches has to be proportional to ε, which causes instability of both algorithms when the desired accuracy is high. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel proximal-{IBP} algorithm, which can be seen as a proximal gradient method, which uses {IBP} on each iteration to make a proximal step. We also consider the question of scalability of these algorithms using approaches from distributed optimization and show that the ﬁrst algorithm can be implemented in a centralized distributed setting (master/slave), while the second one is amenable to a more general decentralized distributed setting with an arbitrary network topology.},

	abstract = {We study the ﬁxed-support Wasserstein barycenter problem ({FS}-{WBP}), which consists in computing the Wasserstein barycenter of m discrete probability measures supported on a ﬁnite metric space of size n. We show ﬁrst that the constraint matrix arising from the standard linear programming ({LP}) representation of the {FS}-{WBP} is not totally unimodular when m ≥ 3 and n ≥ 3. This result resolves an open question pertaining to the relationship between the {FS}-{WBP} and the minimum-cost ﬂow ({MCF}) problem since it proves that the {FS}-{WBP} in the standard {LP} form is not an {MCF} problem when m ≥ 3 and n ≥ 3. We also develop a provably fast deterministic variant of the celebrated iterative Bregman projection ({IBP}) algorithm, named {FastIBP}, with a complexity bound of O(mn7/3ε−4/3), where ε ∈ (0, 1) is the desired tolerance. This complexity bound is better than the best known complexity bound of O(mn2ε−2) for the {IBP} algorithm in terms of ε, and that of O(mn5/2ε−1) from accelerated alternating minimization algorithm or accelerated primaldual adaptive gradient algorithm in terms of n. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with both synthetic data and real images and demonstrate the favorable performance of the {FastIBP} algorithm in practice.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07568},
	abstract = {The discrete Wasserstein barycenter problem is a minimum-cost mass transport problem for a set of probability measures with ﬁnite support. In this paper, we show that ﬁnding a barycenter of sparse support is hard, even in dimension 2 and for only 3 measures. We prove this claim by showing that a special case of an intimately related decision problem {SCMP} – does there exist a measure with a nonmass-splitting transport cost and support size below prescribed bounds? – is {NP}-hard for all rational data. Our proof is based on a reduction from planar 3-dimensional matching and follows a strategy laid out by Spieksma and Woeginger (1996) for a reduction to planar, minimum circumference 3-dimensional matching. While we closely mirror the actual steps of their proof, the arguments themselves diﬀer fundamentally due to the complex nature of the discrete barycenter problem. Containment of {SCMP} in {NP} will remain open. We prove that, for a given measure, sparsity and cost of an optimal transport to a set of measures can be veriﬁed in polynomial time in the size of a bit encoding of the measure. However, the encoding size of a barycenter may be exponential in the encoding size of the underlying measures.},

	abstract = {Continuous word representations, trained on large unlabeled corpora are useful for many natural language processing tasks. Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},
